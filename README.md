This branch contains a jupyter notebook and a presentation of [kraken2](https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2), a metagenomic sequence classifier. That is, it takes a set of short reads and tells you which fraction came from which species.

The example in the notebook uses much smaller viral database, since the full tree-of-life database is way too large for colab, and a small number of simulated reads to show different properties of reads.
